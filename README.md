## Contributing

Content changes should ideally first be raised as issues where they can be discussed. Small corrections can be made directly in a pull request.

## Roadmap

### Content

- [ ] [Lesson 5](/5.md): Uses passthrough copy to copy static images to the output folder. Consider switching to `eleventy-img`?
- [ ] All: Remove references of 'modules' and 'sections'; I don't think the lessons were ever divided into those (e.g. [Lesson 16](/16.md)).

### Other

- [ ] Follow tutorial to make sure it works as expected:
  - [ ] Generate example repo/folder/branch for each lesson.
  - [ ] Zip each and link to them from the lesson (https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/learneleventyfromscratch.com/issues/37).
